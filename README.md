I am a Flutter Mobile App Developer with 1.6 years of professional experience building robust, scalable, and user-friendly mobile applications for iOS and Android. I also have working knowledge of native iOS development (Swift), enabling me to handle platform-specific features and enhance iOS user experiences.

I specialize in Flutter and Dart, with hands-on experience in REST API integration, Firebase services, and modern state management solutions. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering polished UI using Material and Cupertino design principles.

I hold a Computer Science degree and combine a strong academic foundation with real-world development experience. I am detail-oriented, self-motivated, and comfortable working both independently and in collaborative teams.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to impactful mobile products and continue growing as a mobile application developer.
